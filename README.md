# CRUD Operations Application
OOP Final Group Project<br>
<br>
  -This program uses a local sql database file, therefore you need to change the local path of the db in the 'Global.cs' class by editing the 'ConnectionString' variable.<br>
  -This program also requires write access to drive 'd:'. But you can change this to a different drive in the 'Encap.cs' class by changing path.
