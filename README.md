# CRUD Operations Application
OOP Final Group Project

This program uses a local sql database file, therefore you need to change the local path of the db in the 'Global.cs' class by editing the 'ConnectionString' variable.
This program also requires write access to drive 'd:'. But you can change this to a different drive in the 'Encap.cs' class by changing path.
